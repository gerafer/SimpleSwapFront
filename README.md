## Test Coverage

This project uses [`solidity-coverage`](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) to measure test coverage on smart contracts.

To generate the local coverage report:

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
open coverage/index.html
This will allow you to visualize which functions and lines are covered by your tests.
